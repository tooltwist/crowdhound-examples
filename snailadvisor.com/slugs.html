					<h3>Description</h3>
					<p>
						<img src="img/slug-1.jpg" style="width: 45%; float: left; padding-right: 20px;">
						We think of slugs as slimy gross things but actually they make wonderful pets. Slugs are easy to care for and they are good for older kids. Younger kids might accidentally squash the slug wanting to hold it, or they might forget to care for the slug.
					</p>

					<p>
						This spotted creepy-crawly also known as Leopard Slug, Great
						Grey Slug, and scientifically as Limax Maximus can be found
						all over the United States and Europe. Although it is not
						native to the United States, it migrated to North America
						probably from the UK and now has spread all across the USA
						as well as across most of Europe. You can find them in
						woods, fields, and gardens under rocks or dead trees because
						they like damp, dark places to rest from the sun, and they
						are almost always near human habitation. Leopard Slugs are
						nocturnal although they do come out in the day when it is
						raining.
					</p>

					<img src="img/slug-2.jpg" style="width: 40%; float: right; padding-left: 20px;">

					<p>
						Slugs are basically snails without shells, and both are
						mollusks. All slugs and snails move by excreting a special
						mucus (slime trail) and pulling themselves along the slime
						with their one muscular foot. If you see a thin silvery
						trail across the ground or your porch you can know that a
						slug or snail was there, and follow to see where it went.
					</p>

					<p>
						Leopard Slugs are yellow/gray and spotted to help them blend
						into their environment and avoid predators like hedgehogs,
						snakes, frogs, toads, turtles, flies and even some humans
						who find them very tasty. If a predator like a frog does eat
						the slug, it will excrete an even more sticky slime than the
						slime it uses to move along, and this extra sticky slime
						clogs up the predator's throat and mouth making it very hard
						indeed for the slug to be eaten. It is usually spat out and
						avoided thereafter.
					</p>

					<img src="img/slug-3.jpg" style="width: 48%; float: left; padding-right: 20px;">

					<p>
						Leopard Slugs grow to as much as eight inches (twenty
						centimeters) long, and their primary food is fungi such as
						mushrooms and other plant matter, although they can move
						fast for a slug and sometimes eat other slugs too. They live
						up to three years, hiding away during the winters and
						feeding and breeding from spring to fall. Slugs are all
						hermaphrodites, meaning that they contain both male and
						female organs, and when Leopard Slugs mate both slugs will
						produce eggs. They hide from twenty to one hundred eggs in
						moist, shady areas such as under mulch, flower pots, dead
						leaves, or boards. The eggs are transparent or iridescent
						spheres around one quarter inch in diameter, and the babies
						hatch looking like tiny versions of their parents. Young
						slugs take two years to reach breeding maturity.
					</p>

					<p>
						If Leopard Slugs live in your area, you can catch your own
						and have an unusual and very interesting pet. You can find
						them most often under rocks, logs or debris, especially if
						there is a garden nearby. Here in the Midwest USA during the
						summer we can go out in the early evening and watch a slug
						parade as they climb our porch steps and up to the hanging
						baskets of cherry tomatoes, where they can strip entire
						branches of leaves and tomatoes in one night.
					</p>

					<p>
						Before you go Leopard Slug hunting you will need to prepare.
						Wear gloves so that if you have to pick up a slug you won't
						get slimed, but make sure that the gloves don't have any
						chemicals on them; get a new pair of kitchen gloves and
						rinse them well to remove any substance left from the
						manufacturing process. Have a home already prepared for your
						slug, and take a clean container such as a quart jar to use
						to carry your new pet home. You might also want to take
						along a flashlight if your slug hunt is late in the evening.
					</p>

					<img src="img/slug-4.jpg" style="width: 39%; float: right; padding-left: 20px;">

					<p>
						Now go slug hunting. Go to a garden or woods and look in the
						leaf litter or under fallen branches, and when you find one
						either pluck it off whatever it is clinging to and pop it
						into your jar or if it is eating, pick the fruit or
						vegetable that the slug is on and put both in your
						container. If you live in snake country, be sure to make
						plenty of noise before you turn over any branches or disturb
						the leaf litter, and try doing the turning with a long stick
						rather than your hands. If a snake is present it likely will
						run for the hills when it hears you coming, but it might
						stay curled up under its hiding place until you frighten it,
						at which point it could strike you.
					</p>

					<p>
						For your slug's home you will need a small aquarium with
						some gravel lining the bottom. You should also get your slug
						some aquarium furniture, plants, sticks and other things to
						decorate the tank and for your slug to climb on. Prepare
						some distilled water in a spray bottle so that you can mist
						the tank every day to provide drinking water for your pet.
					</p>

					<p>
						You will also need to feed your slug every day, just give it
						a small quantity of a variety of vegetables and fruits that
						have been well rinsed. It is very important that the slug
						does not come into contact with any chemicals, otherwise it
						will likely die. Don't handle your slug often; try not to
						pick it up at all. Slugs are amazing in many ways, and
						interesting to watch, but they are somewhat fragile. Also
						make sure that your aquarium has a tight lid and very small
						ventilation holes so that your slug will not escape. If it
						does happen to escape, just follow the slime trail.
					</p>

					<img src="img/slug-5.jpg" style="width: 45%; float: right; padding-left: 20px;">

					<p>
						If you can, also put some moss from the leopard slug's
						natural environment in the tank because moss is good for
						holding water so that the slug can drink throughout the day.
						It is very important that you watch your slug's tank and see
						to it that if the food your give it starts to mold or go bad
						you remove it from the tank and replace it with fresh food.
						You do not want to leave mold or bacteria in your tank, it
						will begin to smell bad and it could kill your Leopard Slug.
					</p>

					<p>
						Leopard Slugs live a long while for a small creature, and it
						will slime its way up and down and around your tank for up
						to three years. They can climb the walls literally and when
						they do you can see their undersides, their one long foot,
						and watch them explore. Kids really enjoy slugs as pets
						because of their ickiness. Don't tap on the glass or
						otherwise harass the slug, it's not good for them. But if
						you follow these simple instructions you can have a
						fascinating and unusual pet, and freak out your friends with
						your "space-alien-looking" pet.
